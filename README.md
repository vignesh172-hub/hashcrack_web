## 📌 About the Project

**HashCrack Pro** is a full-stack web application for password hash cracking, built using Python Flask (backend) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend). It features a hacker-themed dark dashboard, real-time live logs, multiple attack modes, and an export system — making it a professional-grade tool for security research and learning.

This project was built as part of a **15-day Red Team Cybersecurity Internship** to demonstrate knowledge of hashing algorithms, dictionary/brute-force attacks, web development, and security concepts.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Browser (HTML/JS)
      │
      │  HTTP POST (hash + wordlist)
      ▼
Flask Backend (app.py)
      │
      │  Creates job ID → starts background thread
      ▼
Python Thread (hashlib cracking logic)
      │
      │  Updates active_jobs{} with live stats
      ▼
JavaScript Polling (every 800ms)
      │
      │  Fetches /status/<job_id> → parses JSON
      ▼
Browser updates live log + speed stats on screen
```

**Key concept:** Flask never blocks the browser. It starts a background thread for cracking and JavaScript polls for updates every 800ms — this is what makes it "real-time."

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# Generate a test hash in terminal
echo -n "password123" | md5sum
```

Copy the output hash → paste into the Wordlist Attack tab → Load sample wordlist → Start Cracking!

---

## 🛡️ Supported Hash Types

- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA256
- SHA512
- Auto-detection by hash length

---

## 📊 Attack Modes

### 1. Wordlist Attack
Reads passwords from a `.txt` wordlist file, hashes each one, and compares it against the target hash.

### 2. Brute Force Attack
Generates every possible combination of characters (a-z, 0-9) up to a specified length and tries each one.

### 3. Multi-Hash Attack
Accepts multiple hashes at once and runs a wordlist attack against all of them simultaneously.

## 💡 Defense Concepts (What This Tool Teaches)

- **Why MD5/SHA1 are weak** — fast to compute = fast to crack
- **Use bcrypt/argon2** — slow hashing algorithms designed for passwords
- **Salting** — adds random data before hashing to defeat precomputed attacks
- **MFA** — even if password is cracked, second factor protects the account

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Salted hash detection and cracking
- [ ] Hash rate benchmarking
- [ ] API integration with Hashcat (GPU-based cracking)
- [ ] Rainbow table support
- [ ] Docker containerization

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is built **strictly for educational purposes** as part of a cybersecurity internship. It is intended to demonstrate how hash cracking works and why strong password practices matter. **Do not use this tool against systems or accounts you do not own or have explicit permission to test.**
